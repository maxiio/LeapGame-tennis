The soundset manager provided allows the creation, modification and deletion of soundsets. The soundsets created will be automatically used by the game.

To use the manager use a command line tool and run the manager (manager.lnk for windows users) shortcut directly under the folder Soundsets. Each soundset
may contain any or all of the sounds required by the game. Usage example: "./manager set start_game /home/demo/sounds/demo_start_sound.wav" would add the
"demo_start_sound.wav" file to the soundset as the sound with id "start_game".
